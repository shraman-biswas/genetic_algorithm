Genetic Algorithm
=================

Genetic algorithm implementation with tournament selection.  
Performs basic string matching. Evolves the fittest genome string that matches the target string perfectly.  
Uses simple crossover operation that swaps parent genes at a randomly generated crossover point.  
Uses simple mutation operation that increments or decrements character in genome string.   
Uses tournament selection to select 2 fit parents from entire population pool.  
Features:
* genetic algorithm creation
* genetic algorithm destruction
* genetic algorithm epoch
* genetic algorithm run
* display genome helper function
